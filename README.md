# OccuCount
OccuCount is an iOS application developed with Swift and XCode, designed to assist stores of all types in their transition back to normality following the Covid-19 pandemic.

As stores resume operations, they face occupancy limitations, allowing only a specified number of clients inside the premises at any given time. 

The primary purpose of OccuCount is to effectively manage and track the store's occupancy, ensuring compliance with the imposed restrictions.
